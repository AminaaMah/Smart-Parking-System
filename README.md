# Smart Parking System

This project implements a Smart Parking Lot System using **Arduino** and **MATLAB/GNU Octave**.
It combines a hardware-oriented parking control system with a software-based simulation and GUI
to demonstrate intelligent parking management concepts.

## Project Overview
The system is designed to:
- Monitor parking space availability
- Control vehicle access logic
- Simulate parking behavior using a GUI interface
- Support intelligent decision-making in a smart infrastructure context

## Technologies Used
- **Arduino** – hardware control logic (sensors, access control)
- **MATLAB / GNU Octave** – simulation, data processing, and GUI
- **PDF Report** – full project documentation

## How to Use
1. Upload the Arduino sketch to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
2. Run the MATLAB script to launch the parking system GUI and simulation.
3. Refer to the project report for detailed explanations and system design.
